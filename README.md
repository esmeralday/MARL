This is a Jupyter notebook which contains code describing  various multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

We start with simple Q-learning algorithms which are implemented from mathematical theory and then explore the implementations of a deep q-netowrk based on the atari research paper realeased by DeepMind: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf
